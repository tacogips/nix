# Code With Cursor

## Boundaries

Use this skill only when the user explicitly names it or explicitly says to have
Cursor Agent or `composer-2` implement the change.

Do not use this skill:

- for normal Codex implementation work
- for research-only or explanation-only requests
- just because a task is large or complex

## What To Collect First

Before invoking Cursor Agent, gather the minimum concrete context the delegated
implementation needs:

- workspace path
- exact implementation task
- acceptance criteria or expected behavior
- relevant file paths or directories
- verification commands if they are known
- optional `impl-plan` path if one already exists

If an `impl-plan` file already exists, prefer passing the path and instructing
Cursor to read it first instead of restating the entire plan inline.

## Non-Negotiable Sequence For Generic Impl-Plan Requests

If the user did not name a specific plan file or task:

1. Read `impl-plans/PROGRESS.json` first.
2. Select exactly one active plan or one executable task slice.
3. Read at most one selected plan file.
4. Read at most one relevant repository-native command doc such as
   `.agents/commands/impl-exec-auto.md` or `.agents/commands/impl-exec-specific.md`
   if it is needed for the handoff.
5. Launch Cursor after that bounded preflight.

When resolving the selected plan path from `impl-plans/PROGRESS.json`, check
exact candidate paths in this order before doing any directory listing:

1. `impl-plans/<plan-name>.md`
2. `impl-plans/active/<plan-name>.md`
3. `impl-plans/completed/<plan-name>.md`

Only if all exact candidates are missing may you do one narrow lookup scoped to
that exact plan name. Do not start with `impl-plans/active/` as the default
guess, because many repositories keep the authoritative plan file at the top
level.

If `impl-plans/PROGRESS.json` does not exist:

1. Do not keep searching for `impl-plan` files indefinitely.
2. Build one concrete implementation brief from the user's request plus the
   smallest amount of repository context needed.
3. Prefer one failing test, one named file, one named command surface, or one
   obvious diff-adjacent continuation slice.
4. Delegate that single synthesized slice to Cursor immediately.
5. If no concrete implementation slice can be justified, switch to review of
   the current diff instead of speculative implementation.

When extracting active plan names from `impl-plans/PROGRESS.json`, use a query
that returns only plan names, for example:

```bash
jq -r '.plans | to_entries[] | select(.value.status == "In Progress") | .key' impl-plans/PROGRESS.json
```

Do not combine plan-name extraction with task-row flattening in one TSV stream,
because that can cause the parent agent to misparse task identifiers or
historical plan names as the selected plan.

Do not:

- run `rg --files impl-plans`, `find impl-plans`, or similar whole-tree listing
  before `impl-plans/PROGRESS.json`
- scan the entire `.agents/commands` or `.agents/agents` tree
- read multiple plan files speculatively
- spend the whole run on narrowing without ever delegating

## Impl-Plan Requests

If the user asks to implement from `impl-plan` or `impl-plans` but does not
name a specific plan or task, do not send Cursor a vague "implement the
impl-plans" prompt.

First narrow the work:

1. If `impl-plans/PROGRESS.json` exists, read it first.
2. Select one concrete non-completed plan. Prefer:
   - a plan already marked `In Progress`
   - otherwise the first plan with executable non-blocked tasks
   If `impl-plans/PROGRESS.json` does not exist, synthesize one concrete slice
   from the user request and local repository evidence instead of trying to
   infer a plan tree.
3. Do not enumerate the entire `impl-plans/` tree before reading `PROGRESS.json`.
4. Read only the selected plan file, not the entire `impl-plans/` tree.
5. Choose one concrete task or one bounded checklist slice from that plan.
6. If the selected task is still broad, reduce it to one file-scoped or
   failing-test-scoped first pass before delegating.
7. If the repo contains workflow-specific implementation commands such as
   `.agents/commands/impl-exec-auto.md` or `.agents/commands/impl-exec-specific.md`,
   mirror those repository rules in the Cursor-facing prompt instead of using
   a generic "read all plans and code" instruction.
8. If the most recent plan progress log names a concrete blocker or failing
   assertion, prefer that blocker as the delegated slice instead of a broader
   architectural continuation.
9. If there is no executable implementation slice, tell Cursor to review the
   current diff instead of attempting speculative implementation.

For impl-plan-driven delegation, the parent prompt should already answer:

- which plan path was selected
- which task or checklist slice was selected
- why that slice was selected
- what verification commands to run
- what to do if the slice is blocked

## Preferred Execution Path

Use direct local CLI execution with `cursor-agent`, and prefer streaming output:

```bash
cursor-agent --print --output-format stream-json --stream-partial-output \
  --trust --workspace /abs/workspace/path \
  --model composer-2 "First read /abs/impl-plan.md, then implement the task.
Run the requested verification commands. At the end, summarize files changed
and verification results."
```

If there is no `impl-plan`, put the concrete implementation instruction directly
in the prompt.

Do not default to plain `--print` text output for long-running implementation
tasks, because the parent session can look hung while Cursor is still working.

## Parent-Agent Monitoring

When Codex is calling Cursor from inside another agent run, do not rely on one
blocking foreground `cursor-agent` command if the parent shell/tool surface does
not stream child stdout incrementally.

Prefer the bundled monitor helper:

```bash
~/.codex/skills/code-with-cursor/scripts/cursor-agent-monitor.sh start \
  --state-dir "$state_dir" \
  --workspace /abs/workspace/path \
  --model composer-2-fast \
  --prompt-file "$prompt_file"
```

Then poll from the parent run:

```bash
~/.codex/skills/code-with-cursor/scripts/cursor-agent-monitor.sh poll --state-dir "$state_dir"
~/.codex/skills/code-with-cursor/scripts/cursor-agent-monitor.sh status --state-dir "$state_dir"
```

Use this monitored path when:

- the parent agent is Codex or Claude
- the user expects visible progress
- the delegated run may take longer than a few seconds

The monitor helper writes Cursor NDJSON to a state directory, starts Cursor in
the background, and lets the parent agent poll concise progress without
silently blocking on a single shell command.

## Prompt Contract

The delegated prompt should contain:

1. The implementation request in imperative form.
2. The workspace path and target scope.
3. The exact files or directories to edit when known.
4. The verification commands to run when known.
5. The path to any existing `impl-plan`, with an instruction to read it first.
6. A requirement to summarize files changed and verification results at the end.
7. A requirement to keep emitting streaming output while work is in progress.
8. For impl-plan work, the exact selected plan path and selected task/checklist slice.
9. A requirement to either make concrete file edits or return an explicit blocker
   that names the blocking plan/task/dependency. Do not allow a silent no-op.
10. When the parent agent synthesized a narrower brief, preserve the user's
    original request verbatim in a section labeled exactly `Original prompt:`.
11. If the parent agent already named target files, treat those files as the
    mandatory first edit scope. Do not branch into broader cross-surface reads
    before the first write unless a directly referenced type/test dependency
    forces it.

Keep the prompt concrete. Do not paste large repository overviews unless they
are required.

## Execution Rules

- Default model: `composer-2`
- Default runner: direct `cursor-agent`
- Default mode: normal implementation mode, not `plan`
- Default output mode: `--print --output-format stream-json --stream-partial-output`
- For a single-pass delegation from another agent, `composer-2-fast` is the
  preferred default unless the user explicitly asked for `composer-2`.
- Use `--resume <chat-id>` only when continuing an existing Cursor session is
  clearly better than starting fresh.
- Keep the command simple unless there is a clear need for resume or wrapper
  behavior.
- When the user values responsiveness over maximum depth, `composer-2-fast` is
  an acceptable fallback, but do not silently swap models unless latency is the
  actual problem you are trying to solve.
- Do not let Cursor stop after reading plan files, command docs, or help text.
  It should either produce a concrete patch, run the requested verification, or
  return a blocker with exact evidence.
- When the parent prompt already names exact target files and focused tests,
  Cursor should begin with those files and make the first concrete edit before
  expanding into unrelated surfaces such as CLI, GraphQL, or TUI unless
  compilation or failing tests show that expansion is necessary.
- Do not run package-manager install commands such as `bun install`, `npm install`,
  `pnpm install`, or `yarn install`, and do not modify lockfiles, unless the
  user explicitly asked for dependency updates or the task itself is about
  dependency management. If verification is blocked by missing local
  dependencies, return that as an explicit environment blocker instead of
  mutating the workspace.

## Runner Selection

Read [execution-surfaces.md](references/execution-surfaces.md) when you need to
decide between direct `cursor-agent`, the `cursor-cli-agent` wrapper, and
non-options such as the Codex `web` tool.

## Expected Parent Workflow

1. Build or locate the concrete implementation instruction.
2. Prefer an existing `impl-plan` path when available.
3. For generic impl-plan requests, resolve them into one concrete plan/task
   slice before delegating.
4. When running inside another agent, prefer
   `~/.codex/skills/code-with-cursor/scripts/cursor-agent-monitor.sh` so the
   parent can poll progress instead of blocking silently.
5. Inspect Cursor output and surface visible progress back to the user if the
   delegated work is taking a while.
6. Review and verify any resulting code changes in the parent session before
   reporting back.
